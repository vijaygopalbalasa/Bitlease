# BitLease Demo Video Script
## "Bitcoin-Backed Asset Leasing Protocol"

### INTRODUCTION (30 seconds)
**[Screen: Homepage]**

"Hello, I'm excited to introduce you to BitLease - the world's first Bitcoin-backed asset leasing protocol. 

BitLease solves a massive problem: Bitcoin holders have $1.3 trillion locked up, earning nothing, while businesses desperately need access to expensive assets like GPUs, cars, and equipment.

Our protocol unlocks Bitcoin's value without selling it, creating a new $100+ billion market opportunity."

### THE PROBLEM (45 seconds)
**[Screen: Show statistics/charts if available, or homepage with key metrics]**

"Today, Bitcoin holders face a dilemma. They believe in Bitcoin's long-term value but need liquidity for immediate expenses or business needs. Their only options are:

1. Sell their Bitcoin - losing potential upside
2. Take risky centralized loans - exposing themselves to custody risk
3. Let their Bitcoin sit idle - earning zero yield

Meanwhile, businesses struggle with massive capital requirements for assets like AI GPUs costing $40,000 each, luxury cars, or industrial equipment.

BitLease bridges this gap with a decentralized, trustless solution."

### THE SOLUTION (60 seconds)
**[Screen: Navigate to Stake page]**

"BitLease enables a revolutionary three-step process:

**Step 1: Stake Bitcoin**
Users deposit their Bitcoin into our Core DAO smart contract and receive bBTC tokens - liquid receipts that represent their staked Bitcoin. The Bitcoin earns 5.5% APY while remaining fully collateralized.

**Step 2: Borrow Against Collateral**
Users can borrow USDC stablecoins against their bBTC collateral at a conservative 50% loan-to-value ratio. This means $100,000 in Bitcoin can unlock $50,000 in immediate liquidity.

**Step 3: Lease Assets**
With borrowed USDC, users can lease high-value assets - initially AI GPUs, expanding to vehicles, equipment, and more. They get access to expensive assets without massive upfront costs.

The beauty? Their Bitcoin remains staked, earning yield, while they access the assets they need."

### LIVE DEMONSTRATION - BITCOIN STAKING (90 seconds)
**[Screen: Connect wallet, navigate to Stake page]**

"Let me show you our working protocol on Core DAO testnet.

**First, let's stake some Bitcoin:**

[Connect wallet]
I'll connect my wallet to the Core DAO testnet. Notice we're using Core DAO because it's Bitcoin-native and supports our professional BTC price oracles.

[Navigate to Stake page]
Here's our staking interface. I can see:
- Current BTC price from our multi-source oracle
- My WBTC balance available for staking
- The current 5.5% APY on staked Bitcoin

[Demonstrate staking process]
I'll stake 0.1 WBTC. First, I need to approve the tokens...
[Click Approve] - This transaction gives our contract permission to handle my WBTC.
[Wait for confirmation] - You can see the real transaction on Core DAO explorer.

Now I'll complete the staking...
[Click Stake Bitcoin] - This deposits my WBTC and mints bBTC tokens.

Perfect! I now have liquid bBTC tokens representing my staked Bitcoin, which continues earning 5.5% APY."

---

### LIVE DEMONSTRATION - USDC BORROWING (90 seconds)
**[Screen: Navigate to Lease page, show borrowing section]**

"Now let's use these bBTC tokens as collateral to borrow USDC:

[Navigate to Lease page]
Here's our lending interface showing:
- My bBTC collateral balance
- Current debt position
- Available borrowing capacity at 50% LTV
- Real-time BTC price feeds ensuring accurate valuations

[Demonstrate borrowing]
I'll borrow $25 USDC against my staked Bitcoin. First, I approve my bBTC tokens as collateral...
[Click Approve bBTC] - This allows the lending contract to use my tokens as collateral.

Now I'll borrow the USDC...
[Click Borrow] - This creates a collateralized debt position.

Excellent! I now have $25 USDC in my wallet while my Bitcoin remains staked and earning yield. I can use this USDC for any purpose - paying bills, investing, or in our case, leasing assets."

---

### LIVE DEMONSTRATION - REPAYMENT (45 seconds)
**[Screen: Show repayment functionality]**

"The protocol also handles repayment seamlessly:

When I'm ready to repay my debt, I simply:
[Click Repay] - The system automatically pays back my USDC debt and releases my Bitcoin collateral.

This completes the full cycle - I accessed liquidity without selling my Bitcoin, and now I have both my original Bitcoin plus any yield earned during the staking period."

---

### PHASE 2 - GPU LEASING VISION (75 seconds)
**[Screen: Navigate to GPU leasing section]**

"Now let me show you our Phase 2 roadmap - GPU leasing:

[Show GPU selection interface]
Here's our GPU marketplace interface. Users can select from enterprise-grade GPUs:
- NVIDIA A100s at $2.50 per hour
- H100s at $4.00 per hour  
- V100s at $1.80 per hour

[Demonstrate GPU lease simulation]
Let me lease an A100 for 24 hours...
[Fill in details and click lease button]

[Success message appears]
Perfect! This demonstrates our Phase 2 vision where users spend their borrowed USDC to access real GPU infrastructure through partnerships with providers like Vast.ai and Lambda Labs.

In the full deployment, this would:
- Instantly provision a real A100 GPU
- Provide SSH access and API credentials
- Add the lease to the user's dashboard
- Deduct the USDC cost from their borrowed funds"

### DASHBOARD & PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT (45 seconds)
**[Screen: Navigate to Dashboard]**

"Our dashboard provides complete portfolio management:

[Show real data sections]
Users can track:
- Their total Bitcoin collateral
- Available bBTC balance
- Current USDC debt
- Active asset leases
- Portfolio performance and yield

Notice this displays real blockchain data - actual staked amounts, real debt positions, and live transaction history. The mock GPU leases demonstrate our future vision while the financial protocol is 100% functional today."
